# 12-web-scraping-hw

This assignment showcases my ability to build a web application that scrapes various websites (NASA News, Mars Weather Twitter, etc.) for data related to Mars and displays the information on a HTML page. This assignment is possible with the use of Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, Requests/Splinter, MongoDB, flask application, and HTML.
